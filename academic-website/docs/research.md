# Research

My research focuses on developing novel algorithms and computational methods that advance the state of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am particularly interested in the intersection of theoretical foundations and practical applications.

## Current Research Areas

### Neural Network Optimization
Developing efficient training algorithms for large-scale neural networks, with emphasis on:
- Adaptive learning rate scheduling
- Gradient compression techniques
- Distributed training optimization
- Memory-efficient architectures

### Sustainable AI
Investigating methods to reduce the environmental impact of machine learning:
- Energy-efficient model architectures
- Carbon-aware training strategies
- Model compression and pruning
- Green computing for AI workloads

### Theoretical Machine Learning
Advancing our understanding of learning algorithms through:
- Generalization bounds and learning theory
- Optimization landscape analysis
- Convergence guarantees for adaptive methods
- Statistical learning foundations
