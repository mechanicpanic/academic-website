## Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching is built on several core principles:

### Active Learning
- **Hands-on Projects**: Students implement algorithms and build systems from scratch
- **Interactive Discussions**: Encouraging questions and collaborative problem-solving
- **Real-world Applications**: Connecting theory to current industry practices

### Inclusive Environment
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Welcoming students from all backgrounds and experience levels
- **Multiple Learning Styles**: Combining lectures, visual aids, coding exercises, and group work
- **Supportive Community**: Fostering peer learning and collaboration

### Current Relevance
- **Industry Connections**: Bringing in guest speakers and industry case studies
- **Cutting-edge Research**: Incorporating recent developments and ongoing research
- **Practical Skills**: Teaching tools and methodologies used in professional settings
